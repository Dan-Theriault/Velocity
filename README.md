# dx/dt

dx/dt ("velocity") is a light file-opening utility, inspired by Notational Velocity. It currently lacks such luxuries as 'graphical interfaces', 'tests',  or 'polish'. It is, however, much more hackable.

With dx/dt, you can:

- Create or open any type of file
- Use editor programs of your choice
- Organize notes into notebooks
- Define templates for new notes

dx/dt is an unopinionated tool that lets you do what you want with it.

The core file-opener function and configuration management are currently available through a CLI.

# Configuration

Notebooks are the basic organizational model of dx/dt. Configuration is defined in ~/.dxdt/config (can also be changed using the dxdt-set and dxdt-bind CLIs). (Inline comments are not supported - dx/dt uses configparser).

Example Configuration:

```shell
# default behavior, editor and book are the only implemented fields.
[default]
editor = xdg-open
book = notes

[notes]
# Path and Extension must be defined for every notebook. Other settings are optional
# This notebook opens files in vim, in a new gnome-terminal window
path = ~/Notes
extension = .md
editor = gnome-terminal
# The arg system is somewhat ugly and may be reworked.
arg1 = -e
arg2 = vim
# The path to the file in use is appended to the final arg

[psyc]
path = ~/Documents/PSYC-100
extension = .xoj
editor = xournal
# xournal, like many graphical programs, has issues with totally empty files.
# Using an empty .xoj file generated by the program prevents bugs.
template = blank.xoj

[org]
path = ~/org
extension = .org
editor = emacs
```


# Usage
Usage examples assume use of example configuration.

### dxdt
```shell
dxdt todo # Open a file at '~/Notes/todo.md' in vim (default notebook usage)
dxdt org jul06 # Open a file at '~/org/jul06.org' in emacs 
```

### dxdt-set and dxdt-bind
